        <h1 class="header1">Did you know, There are more than 160+ types of meat out there? How many of them have you
            tried?</h1>
        <h2>Here are some types of meat you may be familiar with.</h2>
        <p class="img-center"><img src="https://leafyplace.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/post1378.jpg" alt="meat on steroid"></p>

        <p> Many types of meat have been the staple diet for humans since the start of time. The most popular kinds of
            red meat are beef, lamb, and pork. The most popular type of white meat is poultry, with chicken coming out
            on top of the list of favorite meats. The red meat and white meat categories also include types of meat such
            as goat, duck, venison, and rabbit.</p>


        <p>As part of a balanced diet, many types of meat are good for your health. The nutritional value of meat shows
            that white and red meat are good sources of protein, vitamins, and nutrients.</p>

        <p>There are also some concerns about the impact of eating too much red meat or processed meat in your diet.
            However, it is also good to remember that the cut of meat and preparation method can greatly impact on how
            healthy cooked meat is for you.</p>

        <p>In this article, you will learn about the most common types of meat you can buy. You will also find out about
            the healthiest kind of meat and if you should be concerned about consuming meat.</p>

        <p>Although fish is classed as a type of meat, some people consider it a separate category. Whatever the
            classification is, the benefits of eating seafood are not addressed in this article.</p>

        <h2>What is meat?</h2>

        <p>In short, meat is defined as the edible parts of an animal that is used for human consumption. Meat can
            include the flesh, fat, muscles, and offal of an animal. The offal is the parts of the animal such as the
            liver, kidney, and tongue that are often consumed or used as part of a recipe.</p>
        <p>Processed meat is a type of meat that most health experts recommend limiting in your diet. Types of meat that
            have been processed include sausages, salami, canned meats, and bacon.</p>

        <h2>Red Meat vs. White Meat</h2>

        <p>The two main categories of meat are white meat and red meat. What is the difference between the two?</p>
        <p>In general, types of meat in the “red meat” category are red before and sometimes after cooking. The reason
            meats such as beef, lamb, and venison are red is because they are high in a protein called myoglobin. This
            is an iron-rich protein that gives certain types of meat their red color.</p>
        <p>Pork meat is also classified as red meat because it contains higher levels of myoglobin than white meat such
            as chicken. Pork is lighter in color than beef and becomes very light when cooked but it is still red meat.
        </p>
        <p>Types of white meat, such as some types of poultry, contain less myoglobin and therefore are white in color.
            However, because myoglobin occurs in muscles, darker meat from chicken and turkeys is found in their legs
            and thighs.
